refactor crafting ui code
- the toggle_ui needs to be broken into more explicit commands
- crafting_manager is a bit of a mess...

- refactor placement system with composition over inheritence
- have pickup behaviors follow checkbox config at pickup level
- refacor item slot code to handle events (runaway DRY causing ambiguous code)
